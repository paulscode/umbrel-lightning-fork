# The channel backup agent the StartOS package runs, and what it needs: rclone
# for the targets, jq for its state, ssh-keyscan/ssh-keygen for SFTP host keys
# and key checks, flock (util-linux) to serialize copies. rclone comes from
# its own release rather than Debian's, which lags the Dropbox and Google
# token handling the agent relies on. The agent is pinned to a commit of the
# package repository: one script serves both platforms.
# Both downloads are checked against pinned SHA-256 sums (rclone's from its
# release SHA256SUMS; the agent's from the pinned commit), so a version pin
# is an artifact pin. curl and unzip leave with the layer.

# The CAs the image trusts. Eight eMudhra intermediates were found in
# October 2026 to have private keys anyone can recover (CVE-2026-111943).
# They chain to emSign ECC Root CA - G3, and through Sectigo's cross-signs to
# Comodo AAA Services root; bookworm's ca-certificates 20250419~deb12u2
# drops both, so the build refuses an older package. emSign Root CA - C1 and
# emSign ECC Root CA - C3 are distrusted as well, as Mozilla removed them
# (NSS 3.131.1, Alpine ca-certificates 20261020) at eMudhra's request in the
# same week; emSign Root CA - G1 is kept, as Mozilla keeps it. The build
# fails if any of these roots is still in the bundle.
# Node uses that bundle (--use-openssl-ca) instead of the roots compiled
# into Node 16, which still trust them; rclone, being Go, reads the bundle
# already.
